# Screenshot Placeholder

This is a placeholder for actual screenshots. 

## How to add real screenshots:

1. Take screenshots of your running application
2. Save them in this folder with these names:
   - main-dashboard.png
   - player-interface.png
   - channel-setup.png
   - playlist-management.png

3. Recommended screenshot specs:
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or similar
   - Format: PNG (for UI) or JPG (for photos)
   - File size: Under 1MB each
   - Show the key features clearly

4. Tips for good screenshots:
   - Use sample data that looks realistic
   - Show the UI in a good state (not loading/error states)
   - Include some channels and playlists
   - Capture at a standard browser zoom level
   - Consider using browser dev tools to simulate different screen sizes
